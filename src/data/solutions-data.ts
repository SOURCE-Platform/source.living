        problem: "Inadequate Problem Solving",
        solutionTitle: "High-Resolution Reality",
        solutionDescription: "Current policy fails because it is based on low-resolution, lagged data. Source provides a real-time, high-fidelity stream of behavioral truth, allowing governance to move from 'guessing' to 'knowing' exactly what is happening in the physical world.",

        problem: "Deepfakes",
        solutionTitle: "Proof of Personhood",
        solutionDescription: "In a world of infinite AI content, 'human' becomes the scarcest asset. Source ID uses continuous biometric authentication to prove that a piece of content was made by a human, solving the 'Dead Internet Theory'.",
