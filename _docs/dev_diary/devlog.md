## 2025-10-26 - Enhanced header navigation UI with descriptions and visual refinements

**Problem:** The header navigation needed visual improvements including: placeholder images for dropdowns, navigation item descriptions, better visual hierarchy, improved icon placement, and proper vertical alignment. Additionally, the SOURCE logo needed to be clickable to navigate to the homepage.

**Root Cause:** The initial navigation implementation was functional but visually minimalâ€”icon placeholders were missing, descriptions weren't present in the data structure, and visual feedback on hover was insufficient. The logo wasn't wrapped as a clickable link.

**Solution:**
1. Added optional `description` field to `NavLinkItem` interface and populated all navigation items with one-line descriptions for context.
2. Made SOURCE logo clickable by wrapping it in a `Link` component pointing to the root URL "/" with proper focus states.
3. Increased placeholder image containers from 48x48px to 64x64px and removed dashed borders for a cleaner look.
4. Expanded dropdown menu width from 320px to 420px to accommodate icon-label-description layout.
5. Changed dropdown link styling from semi-transparent background (bg-muted/70) to fully transparent with hover effect (hover:bg-muted/20).
6. Increased spacing between dropdown items from `space-y-1.5` to `space-y-3` for better visual breathing room.
7. Fixed nav vertical centering by adjusting translate-y from 6 to 4 units and ensuring proper alignment with logo.
8. Added hover effects to top-level nav items: `hover:bg-muted/30` background change with smooth transitions.
9. Increased top-level nav font weight from `text-base` to `font-semibold` for better prominence.
10. Made dropdown container fully opaque by changing from `bg-card/95` with backdrop blur to solid `bg-background`.
11. Restructured dropdown items to display icon vertically aligned with label and description in a column layout.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/main-header.tsx` - Navigation structure, styling, and layout refinements
- `src/lib/navigation.ts` - Added descriptions to all navigation items, updated Hardware labels and URLs

**Outcome:** The header now presents a more sophisticated, information-rich navigation experience with: clear visual hierarchy through better spacing and typography, icon placeholders ready for SVG illustrations, descriptive text helping users understand each section before visiting, improved hover states providing clear interactive feedback, and proper alignment of all elements. The SOURCE logo is now clickable for easy navigation to the homepage.

## 2025-10-23 - Data-driven navigation with category routes

**Problem:** The header mega menu items were static labels without real navigation targets, and there were no category or subpage routes for users to land on.

**Root Cause:** The menu structure lived inline inside `MainHeader()` with plain strings for submenu items, and the `src/app/` directory lacked dynamic routes for categories and detail pages.

**Solution:**
1. Moved navigation definitions into `src/lib/navigation.ts` with typed helpers for finding categories and subpages.
2. Updated `MainHeader()` to render `Link` elements styled as full-width buttons, backed by the shared navigation data.
3. Added dynamic routes under `src/app/[category]/` and `src/app/[category]/[slug]/` to list section links and provide placeholder content for each subpage.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/main-header.tsx`
- `src/lib/navigation.ts`
- `src/app/[category]/page.tsx`
- `src/app/[category]/[slug]/page.tsx`

**Outcome:** Mega menu items now navigate to dedicated category pages with internal section links, submenu selections open their corresponding subpages, and the header dropdown presents fully clickable, accessible link buttons.

## 2025-10-20 - Floating navigation header with scroll transitions

**Problem:** The site needed a dynamic header that transitions from a full-width bar with logo and subscribe form to a compact floating navigation island when users scroll down, with smooth animations and proper content flow underneath.

**Root Cause:** Initial implementation created duplicate nav elements and used sticky positioning that clipped scrolling content. Position transitions between percentage-based (`top-1/2`) and fixed values (`top-6`) caused snapping instead of smooth animations.

**Solution:**
1. Created `SourceLogo` component combining pictogram and wordmark SVGs with light/dark mode support via CSS invert filters.
2. Built `MainHeader` with mega menu navigation structure, newsletter subscribe form, and theme toggle.
3. Implemented scroll detection using ScrollArea viewport element to trigger floating state at 120px threshold.
4. Refactored to single nav element using fixed positioning with transform-based vertical movement for smooth transitions.
5. Applied conditional styling for rounded background, border, padding, and shadow that animate with `transition-all duration-300 ease-out`.
6. Changed header from sticky to fixed with `h-0` when floating to prevent content clipping.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/source-logo.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/main-header.tsx` (new)
- `src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx`
- `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Outcome:** Header smoothly transitions between full-width bar and floating navigation island on scroll, with logo/subscribe form fading out while nav links morph into a centered rounded pill. Content scrolls freely underneath without clipping, and all animations use consistent easing for a polished user experience.

## 2025-10-17 - Gradient play icons and solution layout polish

**Problem:** Video placeholders across sections lacked consistent interactive affordances, solution lists were unstyled, and the CAST/Problem Set descriptions didn't match updated copy.

**Root Cause:** Play icons were only plain placeholders without hover states or consistent sizing, some sections reused generic lists without distinct cards, and marketing copy updates hadn't been propagated.

**Solution:**
1. Added grayscale solution cards with hover-ready play icons across Problem Set, Solutions, and Architecture video frames.
2. Centralized `solution-card` and `video-play-icon` styles in `src/app/globals.css`, including gradient fill, sizing (20% height), and hover transitions without strokes.
3. Updated `public/icons/play.svg` to a fill-only triangle and refreshed hero/problem copy in `src/app/page.tsx`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `public/icons/play.svg`

**Outcome:** All video frames now reveal a gradient play affordance on hover, solution content follows a consistent card design, and copy aligns with the decentralized SOURCE messaging.

## 2025-10-17 - Agent documentation, video styling, and description text refinements

**Problem:** The codebase lacked standardized agent tooling documentation, video placeholders had inconsistent styling across light/dark themes, and description text throughout the site needed improved typography and layout consistency.

**Root Cause:** No AGENTS.md file existed for coding tools, video frames used dark-only styling that didn't adapt well to light mode, and description paragraphs used inconsistent styling classes that were difficult to maintain.

**Solution:**
1. Created comprehensive AGENTS.md file with build commands, architecture overview, and code style guidelines for agentic coding tools.
2. Updated video frame styling to use very light gray backgrounds in light mode and darker gray in dark mode.
3. Consolidated description text styling into a single `.description-text` CSS class with larger, semi-bold typography.
4. Reduced description paragraph width by 33% in the Solutions section for better visual balance.

**Files Modified:**
- `AGENTS.md`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/app/page.tsx`

**Outcome:** Agentic coding tools now have comprehensive project documentation, video placeholders have improved theme-aware styling, and description text throughout the site features consistent, prominent typography with optimized layout spacing.

## 2025-10-15 - Section badges, video placeholders, and favicon restore

**Problem:** Section headers still used outdated micro-labels, video placeholders lacked refined styling, architecture cards were missing media slots, the Three.js gradient component had a malformed return causing build failures, and the favicon no longer matched the white-circle branding.

**Root Cause:** Prior iterations introduced partial UI updates without replacing legacy markup, left placeholder styling untouched, truncated the JSX return in `ThreeGradientBackground.tsx`, and added a `.ico` reference overriding the desired SVG/favicon assets.

**Solution:**
1. Replaced micro-label text with sized `SvgCircle` markers, added spacing, and inserted architecture video placeholders in `src/app/page.tsx`.
2. Restyled `.video-frame` in `src/app/globals.css` to remove shadows, lighten dark-mode fill, enlarge the play icon, and render a rounded equilateral triangle SVG.
3. Restored the JSX return block in `src/three-bg-kit/ThreeGradientBackground.tsx` and removed the `.ico` favicon reference in `src/app/layout.tsx`.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/three-bg-kit/ThreeGradientBackground.tsx`
- `src/app/layout.tsx`

**Outcome:** Landing sections now feature consistent white circle markers with balanced spacing, architecture cards include dedicated video placeholders, the play icon and background styling align with the updated visual direction, the Three.js background compiles cleanly, and the favicon reverts to the branded white circle.

## 2025-10-14 - Integrated Three.js and CSS background system

**Problem:** The marketing site required an animated background experience that matched existing gradient branding, plus tooling to switch between WebGL and CSS implementations with configurable controls.

**Root Cause:** The project lacked a reusable Three.js integration, state management for background presets, and UI controls to manage gradient parameters while preserving the legacy CSS gradient option.

**Solution:**
1. Added a `three-bg-kit/` module with providers, shaders, and presets to render the animated gradient and expose settings.
2. Built `BackgroundAnimation` and expanded global styling to coordinate theme-specific colors, CSS fallback behavior, and favicon assets.
3. Implemented a control panel with tabs for CSS, Simple, Advanced, and Dither options, including editable colors, scaling, angle, and animation controls that update both Three.js and CSS backgrounds.

**Files Modified:**
- `package.json`
- `package-lock.json`
- `public/favicon.ico`
- `public/favicon.png`
- `public/favicon.svg`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/components/svg-circle.tsx`
- `src/components/background-animation.tsx`
- `src/three-bg-kit/GradientControls.tsx`
- `src/three-bg-kit/PostProcessor.tsx`
- `src/three-bg-kit/ThreeBGContext.tsx`
- `src/three-bg-kit/ThreeGradientBackground.tsx`
- `src/three-bg-kit/index.ts`
- `src/three-bg-kit/presets.ts`
- `src/three-bg-kit/shaders/ditherShader.ts`

**Outcome:** The site now supports both Three.js and CSS gradient backgrounds with full control over colors, scale, angles, and animation, providing a flexible visual experience that aligns with theme colors and preserves branding assets.

## 2025-10-13 - Implement themed landing page and wrap workflow docs

**Problem:** The new marketing site lacked theming support, focused landing content, and end-of-session documentation guidance.

**Root Cause:** The scaffolded Next.js project only contained the default template without custom components or workflows for theme management and documentation.

**Solution:**
1. Added theme infrastructure, including `ThemeProvider()` and `ThemeToggle()` components, and wired them through `src/app/layout.tsx`.
2. Replaced the default landing page with a centered `SvgCircle()` element sized to the viewport and ensured dark/light backgrounds transition smoothly.
3. Created `_docs/` directories plus wrap-up workflow documentation to standardize session endings.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx`
- `src/app/page.tsx`
- `src/app/globals.css`
- `src/components/theme-provider.tsx`
- `src/components/theme-toggle.tsx`
- `src/components/svg-circle.tsx`
- `_docs/commands/wrap.md`
- `_docs/dev_diary/devlog.md`

**Outcome:** The app now presents a centered 80% viewport circle with smooth theme toggling, and contributors have clear wrap-up instructions alongside an up-to-date development log.
